# Xs Programming Language
Xs is an open source cross-platform programming language focused on simplicity.

The design goal of this language is to improve the efficiency of reading and writing, reduce the burden of grammar, and enable users to focus their real attention on problem solving.

So we abandon a lot of complicated features and only retain the most general functions. In the end, Xs can express logic gracefully with very little grammar.

## Features
+ Well-designed grammar, easy to write and read.
+ Rules are clear and uniform, intuitive.
+ With the support of. NET platform, we can use this language in a very wide range of scenarios with the help of. NET framework and library resources.
