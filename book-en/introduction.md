# Lite programming language
Lite is an open source cross-platform programming language focused on engineering.

The language is designed to be simple, readable, and understandable.

By removing keywords, reducing grammatical features, and unifying expression specifications, the language can effectively reduce the burden of reading and writing, allowing users to focus on solving problems.

## Features
- Well designed grammar, easy to write and read.
- The rules are clear and uniform, in line with intuition.
- Currently supports output to C#/Go/TypeScript, and with their resources, we can already use this language in a very wide range of scenarios.
- Output to LLVM will be supported in the future to support a more comprehensive scenario.
