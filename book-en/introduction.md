# Xs Programming Language
Xs is a concise open source .NET programming language. 

The language is designed to improve reading performance and reduce the grammatical burden so that users can focus their real attention on business needs.

Therefore, we abandon many subtle grammatical features, retaining only the most used part, and enhance its versatility.

Eventually making Xs with very few grammar, only the presence of symbols on the keyboard instead of keywords is sufficient to express all the logic. 

## Features
+ Focus on writing and reading..
+ Less grammar, no keywords.
+ Clear semantics, one logic corresponds to only one expression.
+ Support for compilation to .NET platform, with .NET framework and library resources, we can use this language in a very wide range of scenarios.
