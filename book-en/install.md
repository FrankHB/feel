# Install
Currently, `XyLang` only supports compilation to` C# `, so you need to have` .Net Framework 4.7.1` installed on your system.

Executing `xylang.exe` will scan the` .xy` file in the current folder and will automatically translate it into a `.cs` file with the same name.

At this stage you need to create a separate `C#` project, you can run these `.cs` files.

After the iteration, we optimize the automated compilation to perform this part of the function, which may eventually be compiled directly into `CIL` and` LLVM` to generate direct binary executables.
